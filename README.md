CodeIgniter HMVC Starter Application
============


Project Goal
------------

A skeleton application based on CodeIgniter. The overall goal of this project is to provide a HMVC skeleton application based on CodeIgniter and using some of the most popular CodeIgniter libraries. This is not a cms, but just a bare bones CodeIgniter install with a few extras to take care of some of the boring work. 

Features 
-----------

**HMVC Modules***

I have included **wiredesignz** HMVC extension. The HMVC extension makes CodeIgniter modular. Modules allow you to bundle your code into what boils down as little mini CodeIgniter Applications. For more information on the how the extension works please click on the link below. 

This is [**wiredesignz's**](https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc "wiredesignz hmvc extension") HMVC extension repo hosted on bitbucket.org.
